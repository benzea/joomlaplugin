= Joomla! 1.0 Integration for Trac =

== About ==

This plugin allows you to have a signle login based on Joomla. It is also
possible to use Joomla groups for rights management.

== Installation ==

Plugin to integrate trac with joomla.

Create the .egg file for trac by running ./setup.py bdist_egg.

== Configuration ==

Please look at joomla/config.py for a list of options.

An example is following. Most of the options can be copied straigt from the
joomla configuration. This is a list of changes I made in my own copy. There
may be some things missing here.

Please refere to authz.py for the configuration of the authz module. There
is nothing special about this module really. Joomla groups can be accessed
with "@Groupname".

[components]
# This disables the normal authentication plugin
trac.web.auth.* = disabled
# This gets rid of the PermissionAdmin panel, because this configuration
# only authenticates using the Joomla authz plugin.
trac.admin.web_ui.PermissionAdminPanel = disabled
# Enable the joomla plugin
joomla.* = enabled


[trac]
permission_policies = JoomlaAuthzPolicy

[joomla]
# Location that users are redirected if they press on the login button. If
# not set, no login link will appear.
login_url = URL

# Location that users are redirected if they press on the logout button. If
# not set, no logout link will appear.
logout_url = URL

# Location of authz policy configuration file.
authz_file = /path/to/joomla_authz


# The Joomla Database that stores the session and user information.
database = mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost/DATABASE

# The table prefix to use.
table_prefix = jos_

# The time until the session expires (in minutes).
session_lifetime=15

# The Secret that Joomla uses to salt its hashes.
hash_secret = SECR3T

# The session name to use (defaults to "site"); you should not need to
# change this
session_name = site

# Cookie hash override for the lazy, just copy the real value from the site
# (default: calculate using "session_name" and "hash_secret").
cookie_hash = HASH
