= Joomla! 1.0 Integration for Trac =

== About ==

This plugin allows you to have a signle login based on Joomla. It is also
possible to use Joomla groups for rights management.

== Installation ==

Plugin to integrate trac with joomla.

Create the .egg file for trac by running ./setup.py bdist_egg.

== Configuration ==

Please look at joomla/config.py for a list of options.

An example is following. Most of the options can be copied straigt from the
joomla configuration. This is a list of changes I made in my own copy. There
may be some things missing here.

[components]
# This disables the normal authentication plugin
trac.web.auth.* = disabled
# This gets rid of the PermissionAdmin panel, because this configuration
# only authenticates using the Joomla authz plugin.
trac.admin.web_ui.PermissionAdminPanel = disabled
# Enable the joomla plugin
joomla.* = enabled


[trac]
permission_policies = JoomlaAuthzPolicy

[joomla]
session_lifetime=15
hash_secret = SECR3T
mysql_user = USERNAME
mysql_pass = PASSWORD
database = joomla_10_production
# Can be used to override the site URL used in the cookie hash
#live_site = joomla.localhost
table_prefix = jos_
groups = A Joomla Groupname, Administrator
authz_file = /path/to/trac/instance/joomla_authz
# The login_url/logout_url is used to create Login and Logout links if present
login_url = http://joomla.localhost/
logout_url = http://joomla.localhost/index.php?option=logout&Itemid=546
